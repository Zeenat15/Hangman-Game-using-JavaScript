# Hangman-Game-using-JavaScript

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The game provides a series of blank spaces representing the unknown word, and the player attempts to fill in the correct letters before making too many incorrect guesses. Typically, the player is allowed six wrong guesses before losing the game. This repository contains a simple implementation of the Hangman game, written in JavaScript, where users can play the game via a command-line interface.
